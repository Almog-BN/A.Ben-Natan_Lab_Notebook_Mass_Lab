# The Leica Emspira 3 and YOU

The Leica Emspira 3 microscope is a digital microscope which allows for detailed observation of samples. The Leica Emspira 3 microscope has no eyepiece; instead, the visual image is shown on a nearby screen.

Leica Emspira 3 microscope is not connected to a computer (only a screen); therefore, to save and collect images, a USB drive is needed. Make sure you have one connected to the SPEED USB slot at the back of the microscope before you start working.

The microscope software can be installed on any PC. You can download it from the MassLab drive.

## Step One – Switch On

Press the ON/OFF button at the back of the microscope.

Wait for the LED to turn white (ready) and for the live image to appear on the monitor.

---

## Step Two – Preparing Your Sample

To protect the microscope, samples should be placed on a Petri plate.  
Make sure the sample lies flat and horizontal on the plate.

## Step Three – Adjusting to Your Preferences

### Focus
Use the focus knobs to bring the sample into sharp view.

### Zoom
Rotate the zoom knob to change magnification.  
Click‑stop: Push the slider toward the knob to enable fixed zoom steps (for measurements).

### Illumination
Press the light button to turn on LEDs; adjust brightness with the + / – buttons.  
This is a segmented light system, so it is possible to turn off part of the LEDs or illuminate from the side.  
Use the middle button to switch modes and arrows to adjust direction of light.
