# The Leica Emspira 3 and YOU

The **Leica Emspira 3 microscope** is a digital microscope that allows detailed observation of samples.  
The Leica Emspira 3 has **no eyepiece**; instead, the visual image is displayed on a nearby screen.

The Leica Emspira 3 microscope is **not connected to a computer** (only to a screen). Therefore, to save and collect images, a **USB drive** is required.  
Make sure a USB drive is connected to the **USB SPEED port** at the back of the microscope before starting work.

The microscope software can be installed on any PC and can be downloaded from the **Mass Lab drive**.

## Step One – Switch On

Press the **ON/OFF button** at the back of the microscope.

Wait for the LED to turn **white (ready)** and for the live image to appear on the monitor.

## Step Two – Preparing Your Sample

To protect the microscope, samples should be placed on a **Petri plate**.  
Make sure the sample lies **flat and horizontal** on the plate.

## Step Three – Adjusting to Your Preferences

### Focus

Use the **focus knobs** to bring the sample into sharp view.

### Zoom

Rotate the **zoom knob** to change magnification.

**Click-stop mode**:  
Push the slider toward the knob to enable fixed zoom steps (recommended for measurements).

### Illumination

Press the **light button** to turn on the LEDs and adjust brightness using the **+ / –** buttons.

This is a **segmented light system**, allowing:
- Partial LED illumination
- Side or diagonal illumination

To switch between illumination modes:
- Press the **middle button**
- Use the **arrow buttons** to change light direction

## Capture Images

- Insert a USB stick into the **USB SPEED port**
- Use the **on-screen display (OSD)** or the optional **footswitch** to capture images
- Images are saved in **JPG / TIF / BMP** formats
- Images can be accessed via the **gallery icon**

### Additional options

- **White balance**: use a white sheet of paper for calibration  
- **Compare mode**: right-click an image in the gallery and choose *Compare* to view it next to the live image  
- **Camera settings**: use the **– / +** button to switch between automatic and manual modes  
- **Measurement**: measurements can be performed on a **live image only** (freeze mode available)

## Step Four – End of Work

- Turn off the **camera and illumination**
- Cover the microscope when not in use
- Clean lenses using a **lens cloth and ethanol only**
- **Never use harsh chemicals**
